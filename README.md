# OntDekker — Travel Social Media Platform

OntDekker (Dutch for *Discoverer*) is a premium, community-driven travel social media and expedition planning platform. This repository is configured as a monorepo containing Next.js frontend applications, independent FastAPI microservices, shared packages, and local docker infrastructure configurations.

## 👥 Developer Ownership Matrix

To minimize merge conflicts and ensure clear ownership, the codebase is divided among three developers as follows:

| Developer | Service Ownership | Shared Area Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Developer 1** | 🔐 `authentication-service`<br>👤 `user-service` | Shared Packages (`shared/`) code design and schemas. |
| **Developer 2** | 📖 `feed-service`<br>🏔 `community-service` | Platform Gateway (`traefik`) and REST API Routing. |
| **Developer 3** | 🥾 `expedition-service`<br>🗺 `guide-service` | Infrastructure configs (PostgreSQL, MinIO, Redis, Docker). |
| **Shared** | 🧠 `recommendation-service`<br>💬 `chat-service`<br>🔔 `notification-service`<br>🛡 `moderation-service` | CI/CD Github workflows, monitoring stack, and monorepo root configs. |

## 🛠 Project Structure

- `apps/web/`: React/Next.js frontend application.
- `services/`: Independent backend microservices (FastAPI + SQLALchemy + Postgres).
- `shared/`: Shared common code package (exceptions, logging, constants, database base classes).
- `platform/`: Unified API Gateway (Traefik) and observability configuration.
- `infrastructure/`: Local third-party services (Kafka, Postgres, Redis, MinIO) setup.
- `docs/`: Technical manuals, team workflows, and visual design assets.
- `scripts/`: Automation, setup, and initialization utilities.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed locally.
- Python 3.12 (for local development outside containers).

### Run the Entire Platform
To start the Gateway, databases, Redis, Kafka, MinIO, and all microservices in the background:
```bash
make run
```
or
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Accessing APIs
Once running, Traefik exposes microservices on port `80`. Exposed endpoints are routed using prefix matching:
- Authentication API: `http://localhost/auth`
- User Profile API: `http://localhost/users`
- Discover Feed API: `http://localhost/feed`
- Community API: `http://localhost/communities`
- Expedition API: `http://localhost/expeditions`
- Guide API: `http://localhost/guides`
- Chat API: `http://localhost/chat`

## 💻 Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker Engine + Docker Compose plugin)
- No other tools required — everything runs inside containers.

### Starting the project

From a fresh clone, a single command starts the entire stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

That is the only command a developer ever needs to run. Everything else happens automatically.

### Expected startup flow

```
postgres          → starts, runs healthcheck
                  → init-databases.sh creates guide_db and trip_db (first run only)
                  → healthcheck passes

guide-service     → waits for postgres healthy
expedition-service→ waits for postgres healthy
                  → entrypoint runs alembic upgrade head (both services)
                  → uvicorn starts

frontend          → waits for guide-service and expedition-service
                  → Next.js production server starts on port 3000
```

Startup is **fully ordered and race-condition-free**:

- PostgreSQL emits a healthcheck (`pg_isready`) before any service connects.
- Service entrypoints poll `pg_isready` before running migrations.
- `alembic upgrade head` is idempotent — it is a no-op if migrations are already applied.
- No `sleep` timers anywhere in the startup chain.

### Automatic database creation

On the first `docker compose up` with a fresh volume, `infrastructure/postgres/init-databases.sh` is executed automatically by the PostgreSQL container. It creates:

| Database   | Service             |
|------------|---------------------|
| `guide_db` | `guide-service`     |
| `trip_db`  | `expedition-service`|

The script is idempotent — re-running it (or restarting the container) does not fail if the databases already exist.

### Automatic migrations

Both `guide-service` and `expedition-service` run `alembic upgrade head` automatically at startup, before uvicorn begins accepting requests. Migrations are:

- **Automatic** — no `docker compose exec` required.
- **Idempotent** — safe to run multiple times; skipped if already at head.
- **Ordered** — only run after PostgreSQL is confirmed ready.

### Accessing the services locally

| Service              | URL                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Frontend             | http://localhost:3000                 |
| Guide Service API    | http://localhost:8002/api/v1/guides   |
| Expedition Service API| http://localhost:8001/api/v1/expeditions |
| MinIO Console        | http://localhost:9001                 |
| PostgreSQL           | `localhost:5433` (postgres / postgres)|

### How to stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

This stops and removes containers but **preserves** the database volume.

### How to rebuild after code changes

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Only changed images are rebuilt.

### How to completely reset (wipe all data)

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

The `-v` flag removes all named volumes, including `postgres_data`. On the next `up`, the databases and migrations are recreated from scratch automatically.

> ⚠️ This deletes all local data. Use only when you need a completely clean state.

## 📜 Git Branch Strategy

OntDekker follows a **GitFlow Branching Strategy** to enable parallel development:

1. **`main`:** Production-stable branch. Deploys are tagged (e.g., `v1.0.0`). Direct commits are blocked.
2. **`develop`:** Integration branch. All features merge here first. Direct commits are blocked.
3. **`feature/*`:** Developer branch. Branches are named `feature/<service-name>-<brief-desc>` (e.g. `feature/auth-jwt-refresh`).
4. **`hotfix/*`:** Hotfixes for production. Branches branch from `main` and merge to both `main` and `develop`.
