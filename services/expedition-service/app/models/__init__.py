# models package initialisation
#
# CRITICAL FOR ALEMBIC: every model module must be imported here.
#
# When alembic/env.py runs `from shared import Base` and then reads
# `Base.metadata`, SQLAlchemy only knows about tables whose ORM classes
# have been imported into the Python process. Importing them here ensures
# that simply doing `from app.models import *` or importing this package
# is sufficient for Alembic autogenerate to detect every table in trip_db.
#
# Import order follows the dependency graph (parent before children):
#   Expedition → everything else
